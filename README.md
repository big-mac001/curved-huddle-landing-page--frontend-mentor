## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Building Huddle's landing page presented me with an opporturnity to deepen my understanding of CSS' custom padding and margin properties and where to apply them rightly. Additionally, I'm particularly proud of understanding the logic behind properly using the wavy images as background images to form the borders of the features section. I was used to using the background-size property with a cover value on the background image. However, this time I learned to use the height and width properties on the image to keep the image in proportion and maintain its wavy edge, and using a corresponding background-color on the rest of the section's body.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on building projects with all I have learned and improve my design thinking skills. I had a bit of a hard time working on the project because I was only thinking like a developer and not also like a designer.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.programiz.com/css/background-size) - This helped me understand that the background-size property takes an additional value for the height of the image while using the length value.
